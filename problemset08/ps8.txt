We chose design no. 5, because it leaves most space to the
board itself, which is where most of the information is present.
We also tried to reduce redundant information and tried to find
a way to structure the screen in an intentional way, so it's
not necessary to provide much information about the UI.

Additionally, if ACME ever wanted to make it a mobile app,
the most used buttons (bottom right) are in an area where the
thumbs may reach them easily.
